Read up and implement a simple web service using nodejs.
It will have these methods:
add2: to add 2 given numbers and return the sum
accumulate: to add a give number and return the total
reset: to set the total back to zero
Once ready, you should be able to call the web service methods using:
browser: http://localhost:8282/add2?first=5&second=6
command line: curl "http://localhost:8282/add2?first=5&second=6"
